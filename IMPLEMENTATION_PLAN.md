## Notes for Implementation

- Keep each task small and achievable (1-4 hours maximum)
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next
- Document any deviations from the plan and reasoning
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over advanced features
- Each phase should result in a working, demonstrable state
