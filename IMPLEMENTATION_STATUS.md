### Build Instructions
```bash
# Automated setup (recommended)
python scripts/setup.py

# Manual setup (alternative)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

# Run in development mode
python main.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Build production executable
python scripts/build.py

# Clean build artifacts
python scripts/clean.py

# Results:
# - dist/NiceGUI-Desktop-App (standalone executable)
# - dist/NiceGUI-Desktop-App.app (macOS application bundle)
```

### Application Features Demonstrated
- **Text Processing**: Real-time input processing with character counting
- **Counter Demo**: State management with increment/decrement/reset

- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive exception handling at network, UI, and application levels
- **Port Management**: Automatic free port detection with fallback mechanisms
- **Build Optimization**: Exclusion of development packages, debug symbol stripping, size optimization
