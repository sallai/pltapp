# Implementation Status

## Current Project State (June 18, 2025)

### Project Overview
Technology demonstration of NiceGUI UI application packaged into native executable using PyInstaller. Focus on simplicity and comprehensibility.

### Current Status: ALL STAGES COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY
- ✅ Project structure established with proper modular design
- ✅ Development tooling configured (Black, Ruff, MyPy, pytest)
- ✅ Build scripts created and optimized (PyInstaller configuration)
- ✅ Virtual environment setup automated
- ✅ Core application implementation with NiceGUI UI components
- ✅ Development mode testing successful
- ✅ Code quality validation passing (ruff, black, mypy)
- ✅ NiceGUI native packaging and PyInstaller integration complete
- ✅ macOS .app bundle creation working
- ✅ Cross-platform build configuration optimized
- ✅ Production-ready executable created and tested

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Dependencies**: NiceGUI 2.20.0+, FastAPI, uvicorn
- **Build Tool**: PyInstaller with native window support
- **Code Quality**: Ruff linter, Black formatter, MyPy type checker
- **Project Structure**: Keeping simple flat structure for demo
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ for performance and typing features
